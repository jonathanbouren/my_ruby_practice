=begin
In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as visible or hidden.
Weire an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright" if sun equals visiible. Also, write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun equals visible.
When writing these statements, take advantage of ruby's expressivements and use statement modifiers instead of if...end statements to print results only when some condition is met or not met.
=end

  sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample




























=begin
  print "The sun is so bright!" if sun == 'visible'
  print "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun == 'visible'
=end
